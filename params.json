{"name":"GridShader","tagline":"Experiment with a grid-shading puzzle","body":"### Welcome to GridShader\r\nThis tool allows you to experiment with a grid-shading puzzle published by [GCHQ](http://www.gchq.gov.uk/press_and_media/news_and_features/Pages/Directors-Christmas-puzzle-2015.aspx)\r\n\r\n### How it Works\r\nIn the 25x25 grid, cells are arranged in contiguous blocks, with the lengths of the blocks being given for each row and column. Each of the contiguous blocks must be separated by at least one empty cell. On this page, the grid is initialised using the information about contiguous blocks, row-by-row. The columnar information has been ignored; instead the blocks have been packed hard to the left. You can select a block and drag it to the left or right (provided of course that that would not result in a collision or overlap with an adjacent block).\r\n \r\n### The Objective\r\nThe goal is to arrange the blocks so that the columnar information on contiguous blocks matches that given in the original puzzle.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe original puzzle was set in December 2015 by the director of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
